Problem description:

time limit per test:    1 second
memory limit per test:  256 megabytes

The length of the longest common prefix of two strings s=s1s2…sn and t=t1t2…tm is defined as the max
integer k ( 0 ≤ k ≤ min(n,m) ) such that s1s2…sk equals t1t2…tk. Koa the Koala initially has n+1
strings s1,s2,…,sn+1. For each i ( 1 ≤ i ≤ n ) she calculated ai — the length of the longest common
prefix of si and si+1. Several days later Koa found these numbers, but she couldn't remember the
strings. So Koa would like to find some strings s1,s2,…,sn+1 which would have generated numbers
a1,a2,…,an. Can you help her? If there are many answers print any. We can show that answer always
exists for the given constraints.

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains t ( 1 ≤ t ≤ 100 ) — the number of test cases.

Solution algorithm:

(from Editorial - https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/80562)

*  Set s1= "aaaa...aaaaaaa" (ie. 200 times 'a').
*  For i such that ( 1 ≤ i ≤ n ) set si+1:=si and then flip (ai+1)-th character of si+1 (ie. if it was
   'a' put 'b' otherwise 'a').
So for each i:

  -  si and si+1 will have exactly ai common characters from the prefix.
  -  The (ai+1)-th character of si+1 is different than (ai+1)-th character of si (this character
     always exists since 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 50 and each string has length exactly 200).

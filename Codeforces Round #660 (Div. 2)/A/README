Problem description:

time limit per test:    1 second
memory limit per test:  256 megabytes

Despite his bad reputation, Captain Flint is a friendly person (at least, friendly to animals). Now
Captain Flint is searching worthy sailors to join his new crew (solely for peaceful purposes).
A sailor is considered as worthy if he can solve Flint's task. Recently, out of blue Captain Flint has
been interested in math and even defined a new class of integers. Let's define a positive integer x as
nearly prime if it can be represented as p⋅q, where 1 < p < q and p and q are prime numbers. For example,
integers 6 and 10 are nearly primes (since 2⋅3=6 and 2⋅5=10), but integers 1, 3, 4, 16, 17 or 44 are not.

Captain Flint guessed an integer n ( 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 ) and asked you: can you represent it as the sum
of 4 different positive integers where at least 3 of them should be nearly prime.
Uncle Bogdan easily solved the task and joined the crew. Can you do the same?

The first line contains a single integer t ( 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000 ) — the number of test cases.

Solution algorithm:

Notice that if solution exists, then at least 6, 10, 14 or 6, 10, 15 are 3 of 4 integers sum of which
equales to n, because that fact that numbers 6, 10, 14, 15, ... are first of nearly prime.

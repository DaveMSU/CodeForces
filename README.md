# CodeForces
Here are all my CodeForces competitions with a code solution, problem description and algorithm description.

I'd started taking part in CodeForces in sep 2019, then I tried my first competition and noticed this very intersting, I get my first rank score is ~1370~. I knew about this kinda resource long before, but I'd never had enough time for including myself in it. So in last 1-2 week I desided to take part in a competitions. So for now my score is 1245. Let's improve it)

With every my participations in competitions I'll provide with task description and my code with comment of how much time it runs and how much memory takes. Also I'll write algorith description to make it easier to understand code. I prefer to code by C++, because I see it much faster then any others program languages high-level programming language. But because competitions are limited in time sometimes I could use Python.

After participating in the competition I will indicate how my rating has changed.
